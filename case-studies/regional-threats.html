  <h1>🌍 Regional Threats Analysis Framework</h1>

  <p>This case study outlines a regional geopolitical analysis project I led, designed to help stakeholders navigate complex security, governance, and operational risks in volatile environments. While this particular project focused on <strong>West Africa</strong>, the methodology and analytical approach are fully adaptable to other regions including <strong>MENA</strong>, the Sahel, and other areas of strategic interest.</p>

  <h2>📌 Context:</h2>
  <p>During a period of heightened insecurity—including terrorism spillovers, political instability, and organised criminal networks—stakeholders required reliable, actionable <strong>regional threat assessments</strong> to guide not only national security policy, but also donor funding decisions, private sector planning, and humanitarian programming.</p>

  <h2>⚙️ My Approach:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Leveraged multi-source intelligence: open-source reporting, field observations, and confidential partner briefings</li>
    <li>Mapped cross-border influence networks and identified key drivers of instability, including illicit trade corridors, extremist recruitment patterns, and coordinated disinformation campaigns</li>
    <li>Produced forward-looking <strong>risk forecasts</strong> with scenario analysis adaptable to multiple regions and sectors</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📊 Key Outputs:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Produced <strong>3 quarterly regional threat assessments</strong> shared with government agencies, humanitarian partners, and private sector stakeholders</li>
    <li>Developed influence maps highlighting <strong>high-risk border zones</strong> and transnational criminal flows affecting supply chains</li>
    <li>Contributed to briefing materials presented during <strong>international diplomatic engagements</strong> and cross-sector consultations</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>✅ Results:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Enabled rerouting of operations in <strong>4 vulnerable logistics corridors</strong>, reducing exposure for both humanitarian programs and private sector operations</li>
    <li>Helped secure <strong> fund commitments </strong> in donor realignments based on evidence-based risk assessments</li>
    <li>Improved coordination between governments, regional bodies, civil society, and international partners by providing <strong>common threat baselines</strong> for joint action</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>📌 Why This Matters:</h2>
  <p>Whether in West Africa, MENA, or elsewhere, regional geopolitical risks directly impact <strong>economic stability, operational planning, and public trust</strong>. My analysis frameworks are <strong>globally adaptable</strong>—designed not only to describe the environment but to actively shape decision-making across both public and private sector contexts.</p>
