  <h1>üåç West Africa Regional Threats Analysis</h1>

  <p>This case study highlights a regional geopolitical analysis project I led, aimed at helping stakeholders navigate the complex risk environment across West Africa. This work provided both <strong>public-sector partners</strong> and <strong>private sector actors</strong> with early warning insights and risk mitigation strategies for operating in unstable regions.</p>

  <h2>üìå Context:</h2>
  <p>During a period of heightened insecurity linked to terrorist activity spillovers from the Sahel and political instability across multiple states, stakeholders required accurate, actionable regional threat assessments to guide policy interventions, security programming, and investment planning.</p>

  <h2>‚öôÔ∏è My Approach:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Leveraged multi-source intelligence, including open-source reporting, field observations, and strategic briefings from regional security partners</li>
    <li>Mapped cross-border influence patterns and identified potential vectors of instability (e.g., illicit trade corridors, disinformation campaigns, extremist recruitment pathways)</li>
    <li>Produced forward-looking <strong>risk forecasts</strong> with scenario analysis tailored to both humanitarian needs and commercial exposure risks</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üìä Key Outputs:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Produced <strong>3 quarterly regional threat assessments</strong> circulated to both inter-agency coordination platforms and selected private sector clients</li>
    <li>Developed influence maps highlighting high-risk border zones and transnational criminal networks impacting supply chains</li>
    <li>Contributed to briefing material presented during diplomatic consultations and multinational donor engagements</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>‚úÖ Results:</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Helped public and private sector partners reduce exposure in high-risk regions, contributing to the rerouting of operations and logistics in <strong>4 vulnerable corridors</strong></li>
    <li>Supported partner programs in securing <strong>$2.5 million</strong> in redirected donor support by providing evidence-based threat analysis that aligned with emerging security needs</li>
    <li>Improved regional coordination between civil society, governments, and international partners by providing common threat baselines to drive joint action</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>üìå Why This Matters:</h2>
  <p>Geopolitical risks are no longer limited to governments and military planners‚Äîthey directly impact <strong>economic stability, investor confidence, and humanitarian outcomes</strong>. My approach ensures that regional intelligence is not only rigorous but operationally useful to a wide range of stakeholders navigating West Africa‚Äôs evolving security environment.</p>
