Strategic Intelligence Analyst| Geopolitical Risk| Policy & Governance

📊 Introduction

I help governments, non-profits, and private sector organisations make clear, confident decisions in uncertain environments. With over 5 years' experience in intelligence analysis, geopolitical risk, and public policy, I specialise in translating complex regional and global dynamics into actionable intelligence and strategic foresight. My work has shaped cross-border security efforts, democracy programs, and strategic partnerships across Africa, the Sahel and beyond.  
What I bring:
*Strategic Intelligence & Risk Analysis
*Stakeholder Engagement & Coalition Building
*Policy Advisory for Governance & Security
*Information Integrity & Counter-Disinformation
📊 Remote-ready, globally oriented and focused on clarity in complexity. 

📊 Overview

Unlike portfolios in design or development, intelligence and geopolitical risk work often happens behind the scenes — in briefings, secure conversations, and fast-moving decision spaces.
What I can share here is how I think: the analytical frameworks I use, the decision models I rely on, and the strategic processes that help organisations turn complexity into clarity.
